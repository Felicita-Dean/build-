#This is my third time practicing github and it only gets better as i keep on holding to it
#Giving up is not an option for me so i press on
#The best test comes in perseverance and patience
#I have learnt that you only stick your neck out for people who matter
#I let God plan all i can do is pray and ask him to approve my plans for i cannot comaman God
God all God by himself
