what we need to work on is to get forget our past
I hang on God all my life for everything 
I make sure to add more time into my training everyday
My life is living sacrifice to God
I like to appreciate God and i have learnt humility in the process 
I appreciate the advice i get from the people around
My God has been my defender in all my ways
I think i am getting better at github by the day
